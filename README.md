# ShapeAnimation-Swift

Vector animation framework in Swift based on [SwiftGraphics](https://github.com/schwa/SwiftGraphics) for iOS 8.

With ShapeAnimation you can easily create various animations with a nice Swift based syntax.

SVG animation development with [SVGKit](https://github.com/SVGKit/SVGKit) happens on the [SVG][svg_branch] branch.

## What's included

* ShapeView class which contains vector shape layers.
  * Helper functions to add image, text, circle, regular polygon, lines and other shapes.
  * Support gradient fill with animation.
  * Enumerate, hit-test or find layers.

* Animation extension functions of CALayer.
  * opacityAnimation, flashAnimation, backColorAnimation
  * scaleAnimation, tapAnimation, transformAnimation
  * rotate360Degrees, rotationAnimation
  * shakeAnimation, moveAnimation, moveOnPathAnimation
  * slideToRight, slideAnimation, flipHorizontally, flipVertically
  * Layer dragging: constrainCenterToSuperview, bringOnScreen

* Animation extension functions of CAShapeLayer.
  * strokeStartAnimation, strokeEndAnimation, lineWidthAnimation
  * strokeColorAnimation, fillColorAnimation, dashPhaseAnimation
  * switchPathAnimation

* Group animation and cascaded animation.
  * animationGroup for the same layer
  * applyAnimations for multiple layers
  * Use the block-based function in apply() to play cascaded animations.
  * Pause, resume or stop animations.

* Animations with customized properties
  * Use AnimationLayer class to draw customized animations.
  * Animation with sliders example: [EllipseViewController.swift](ShapeAnimation_UITest/EllipseViewController.swift)

## Usage

Please see the examples in [MasterViewController.swift](ShapeAnimation_UITest/MasterViewController.swift).

``` Swift
let layer1 = self.addLinesLayer(view, points:[(10.0,20.0),(150.0,40.0),(120.0,320.0)])
layer1.strokeEndAnimation().apply() {
    layer1.shakeAnimation().apply()
}

let la2 = self.addLinesLayer(view, points:points2, color: UIColor.blueColor())
lla2.scaleAnimation(#from:1, to:1.1, repeatCount:3).apply(duration:0.3)

let la3 = self.addLinesLayer(view, points:points3, color: UIColor.greenColor())
la3.flashAnimation(repeatCount:6).apply()

let la4 = self.addLinesLayer(view, points:[(10.0,20.0), (150.0,40.0), (120.0,120.0)])
let a1 = la4.moveOnPathAnimation(path).setDuration(1.6)
let a2 = la4.rotate360Degrees().setRepeatCount(2)
animationGroup([a1, a2]).autoreverses().apply()
```

## Help Wanted

All of this code is very much a _*work in progress*_. I'm adding and changing functionality as needed.

Your help wanted. Please fork this project and submit pull requests or [issues][issues].
